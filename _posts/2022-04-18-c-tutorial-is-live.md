TL;DR My tutorial of the C language is live at [learn-c.nishantkompella.me](http://learn-c.nishantkompella.me). Check it out.

A couple of weeks ago, while I was applying to the BWSI Summer Program, I had a couple of hours to kill and I created a [C Language Programming Tutorial](http://infection-tag.github.io), hosted on GitHub Pages. Last week, I got this domain. I think you can see where I’m going with this.

In my last update, I added the fact that there were so many things I wanted to do for this site, now that I had the hang of adding wikis, including a C language tutorial and a Markdown tutorial. I still haven’t figured out how to port the Markdown tutorial. The good news is, I created a wiki for my C tutorial at [learn-c.nishantkompella.me](http://learn-c.nishantkompella.me).
