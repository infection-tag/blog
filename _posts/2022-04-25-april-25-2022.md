## Grandparents

My grandparents came over on Friday night. My dog has not stopped barking since they came.

## Grades

The year is coming to an end, and my GPA will tank if I don’t fix my grades. I need to find time to talk to my teachers about them.

## Hear Me Out

I need to build a set for my sitcom. After that, I will be good to shoot it. The sitcom will be called “Hear Me Out”, and I ordered stickers just for fun in it.
