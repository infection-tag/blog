Check the project out [here](http://archive.nishantkompella.me).

Initially, I had started the [archiving project](http://blog.nishantkompella.me/2022/04/19/archive-addition/) to salvage what I could of my past internet sites. It took a while to find them (most of the sites were gone, and I had to look for alternative sources to find them: backups, source code, etc.) This morning, however, I managed to find the missing piece of the puzzle: my old HTML-based website, [nikok.ml](http://nikok.netlify.app).

For now, though, we are done with this. It is time for me to get down to other projects.
