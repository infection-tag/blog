TL;DR: I’m gonna import a blog from last year from Blogger to WordPress. Also, I’m gonna make an archive of my life and everything on the internet about it thus far.

Last year, during distance learning, my parents gave me the worst computer imaginable – **an eleven year old centOS running PC**. I always felt jealous of my classmates, because of their machines that would actually work.

Anyways, I tried making something out of nothing and created [a blog](https://centosgeek.blogspot.com/) for those who were in a similar predicament. The blog has since been abandoned, but I though it may be worth archiving. There are a lot of typos, but hey, they’re readable.

I’m probably going to move it into [centosgeek.nishantkompella.me](http://centosgeek.nishantkompella.me). It’s kind of a lengthy subdomain, though, so I’ll probably create an [archive (archive.nishantkompella.me)](http://archive.nishantkompella.me) with all of my previous internet endeavors. I have a couple of old .ml sites, but they have been lost. I’ll try to find a way to salvage the source code, but until then, I’m gonna upload the CentOS Geek.

Dealing with subdomains is kind of tedious, but thanks to infinityfree, I get infinite subdomains, so it’s really nice.
