In today’s world, there is so much pressure in life. When you’re a kid, you get 15 years of some sort of relaxation — less, depending on your aspirations. From that point on, life seems to take off and stress becomes normalized. There are a lot of roadblocks that you have to overcome, thinking it will be the last.

Human behavior fascinates me. There is a lot of pointless hubbub surrounding topics pushed towards as a society, none which are actually useful.

## Colleges

The base idea of getting into a good college is stupid. The entire base theory of a good school is to enlighten those who lack knowledge. At one point, it stops becoming about that. As schools try their best to shove erroneous propaganda down its students’ throats, life becomes a race to get into the best colleges. What’s the degree worth? A promotion. What’s the education worth? Fuck-all.

## Attention

I’m sorry, but attention, no matter where you get it from, is useless. You cannot possibly tell me having a YouTube account with 1 Million subscribers is worth… *anything*. It’s a lot of people, I’ll admit. But, supposedly 5 Billion people in the world have access to internet. Your channel is just another grain of sand in the beach.

It started as jewelry, and somehow we’ve gone from that to twerking on TikTok in less than 50 years. Come on, humanity. We’re making fools of ourselves.

## Popularity

From elementary school, everyone wants to be that one popular kid.

As you get older, you realize you don’t. In fact, no one likes the popular person. They all just pretend to.

## Blogs

Kinda hypocritical, huh? But in reality, unless you are Elon Musk, no one cares about you. There. I said it. No one cares. The only blogs that have achieved popularity aren’t *blogs* so much as *newsletters*. No one cares about your opinion — unless it is your own. And if someone else (namely a politician) has the same opinion as you, something’s afoot. Speaking of your opinion,

## Opinions

No one cares. Really. Stop telling me your opinion unless I ask for it or it’s a personal matter. I really don’t care about who *you think* should have won the 2016 Presidential Election.

## Gossip

This really topples everything up above, doesn’t it? Gossip is like a snake; you don’t know who to confide in; you don’t know who to tell what to and what their opinion is on a certain issue. It feels like the final scene in *The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly*, where the three main characters are ready to shoot one another on Sand Hill.

Stupid, isn’t it? Welcome to humanity.
