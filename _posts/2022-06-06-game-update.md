I know I probably haven’t updated about my game lately, but here is the basic overview:

## Name

As of right now, the game is called *Airport*. However, that is subject to change; the majority of the game is not in an airport, it is outside.

## What?

The game is about a man who wakes up in an airport with $5000 in prepaid card and 5 dollars in money. You also have a plane ticket to New Delhi. You go to New Delhi, and from there your adventures begin.

## How am I doing this?

I know, I know — I never was good at coding. I love C, I really do, but learning to use Unity with C++ or C# really isn’t my thing. That’s one of the reasons I have drifted apart from game development and gaming in general — it’s an unfathomable amount of commitment.

However, last year, during independent study, I learned about [Ink](https://github.com/inkle/ink/blob/master/Documentation/WritingWithInk.md). I wrote a simple game which was never shown to the outside world and eventually lost in time. I hope that this won’t be the case for this game.

Anyways, I have found an online (partially outdated) [tutorial on pairing Ink with Unity](https://videlais.com/2019/07/08/unity-ink-part-1-importing-and-testing/), and I have been going from there. It’s a lot of work, but that’s not something completely unknown to me — hence this website, with all of its sub-projects.
