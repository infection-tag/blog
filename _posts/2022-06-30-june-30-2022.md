For once, I don’t have that much to talk about. The only reason I am updating *today*, of all days, is because I have some time and haven’t updated this blog with personal news in a while.

## San Diego Trip

My mom says that we may be going to San Diego next weekend (not this weekend, because it’s 4th of July Weekend and there will be too much traffic) for a couple of days. Not a week, because we will be going for a week near the *end* of summer.

My uncle and cousins live in San Diego (the older one attends UCSD). My grandparents are currently staying there, so we’re going to visit them next weekend and pick them up at the end of summer.

## Swim Meet

I have a small swim meet tomorrow.

Normally, I hate swim meets, but I have gotten to like attending them more and more recently. It’s something that has become pretty fun and challenging recently, and since I am going through the time when it is best to build muscle, I have been attempting to approach more challenges. Earlier, I found comfort in the monotony of life, but now I try to go more out of it.
