There is a huge heat wave going on in my area right now. It seems to be the main driver of today’s events, too.

Here’s an inspirational quote regarding this issue:

## Kayaking

We could not go kayaking today, as planned [earlier](http://blog.nishantkompella.me/2022/06/19/june-18-2022/), due to the heat wave. Instead, we did nothing.

## Lecture

We were *supposed* to have a lecture for a C++ Computer Science Class I am taking over the summer, but the heat wave caused a fire on the college campus, and the lecture got delayed. The thing is, *he told no one about the delay*. I found no information whatsoever on his part. We sent him emails, chat messages, and forum questions, and got no questions. It’s really annoying. Taking this class is a real pain in the ass and I am seriously considering dropping this class.
