TL;DR. I’m writing a C-based programming language. It’s going to be better.

I’m currently writing my own programming language. It’s going to be called Butter. It’s currently an interpreted language. I don’t have time to write it, but this is more for fun. I’m obviously really fun at parties.

## What is it?

My friend and I have a joke about butter — eating pure butter, “Butter, Biking, and Burgers Club”, etc. A few months ago I came up with the idea of a programming language, during a conversation. In that, I suggested to him a programming language called “butter”. It’s full name is *NSSK Butter*. Think ANSI C.

## What will it look like?

It will look a lot like C (don’t they all?) The only difference is, it isn’t as low-level; C is a good language to learn, but when implementing code, it’s a pain in the ass. This will be a much more accessible version — much more readable, much more implementable.

It’s not going to be a super high-level language like Python (I hate Python), but it won’t require unnecessarily tedious coding to get what you want.

Here’s a little [sneak peak](https://gist.github.com/infection-tag/4b38b91beb9b65bdc12651f82e1fe4c4).
