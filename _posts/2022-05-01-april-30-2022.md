## Intersession is Over

Intersession is finally over. Three and a half weeks until the school year ends and I can do whatever the hell I want.

## Swim Meet/Concert

I had a swim meet yesterday. There were two rounds: Qualifying Rounds, which were yesterday, and Championships for the best of each event. I qualified, despite my expectations. However, due to lack of foresight, I did not realize that I had a concert the next day for the LJYE and was unable to attend the final meet.

## Peeves

My cousin and his mother came over yesterday, for my grandfather’s birthday and brought over a 6 dollar balloon attached to a clip. My illiterate and unintelligent brother decided to take the clip away and let the balloon fly away freely, which means a gust of wind or a sharp piece of asbestos on the roof will signify the end of the balloon.

My father used to be funny. Now he teases people to the point where everyone in this cramped apartment — all seven people and the dog — wishes he would shut up. Also, he keeps watching choreography videos with the same goddamned song and dance moves. Turn it off, please, for the love of god.

## snatch

The movie snatch goes off of Netflix tonight, which means I should probably get off of here and watch it. I like it so far.
