## Art Critics

Why does one value art? It provides no value whatsoever; stealing the Mona Lisa isn’t really good for anything. You can’t exactly hang it on the wall for guests.

And people still struggle to pay off their college debt.</figcaption></figure>Art seems to do the opposite of contribution to society; it brings out unrealistic standards which pull out the intuition; the foundations of capitalism and our society.

I guess what I’m trying to say is, art critics are full of shit. I’m surprised that the NFT is the only form of art that has been called out on this; for a long time, humanity has been treating obscure paintings, such as “Black Square”, like gold. Why? How? What kind of psychological manipulations must one put society through to achieve this? Why haven’t photographs and videos achieved this status?

On a completely unrelated note, I’m thinking of going into the painting industry.
