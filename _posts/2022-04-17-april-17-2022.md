Three days ’till getting high day, or, as some innocent-looking monsters call it, Something Appreciation Day.

## Money

I’m really short on cash, I literally have $20 and that’s it. I probably shouldn’t have spent $5 on MnMs, but you live and you learn. There is so much stuff on Amazon and other online shopping markets — I could waste so much money. Currently, I have my eye on true wireless earbuds.

## Plans for Domain

I had another idea for a subdomain — it’s gonna be called “Got Five Minutes?” It will include a single button, which when clicked, will generate a simple activity that takes five to ten minutes. It’s gonna be similar to the [Bored Button](http://boredbutton.com) site, and [the Useless Web](http://theuselessweb.com).

## Wiki

I created a subdomain for my [wiki](http://wiki.nishantkompella.me), in which I installed MediaWiki, which is the same software as Wikipedia. It’s not really easy to work with, so I was thinking of moving on to DokuWiki.

## Neurology

I have decided a potential career in my life is going to be Neurology. I find the study of brains to be extremely interesting, and it seems to be something a lot of people in my direct family lack.

## This Domain

Hopefully I’ll find a way to keep this domain up when the time comes to renew. I’ve wanted a domain for so long, but I was stuck with crappy subdomains (blogspots, wordpress, etc.)
