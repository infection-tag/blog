When *Citizen Kane*, directed and starring debut director Orson Welles, came out, news outlets did everything they could to stamp it out. Nominated for nine (9) oscars in 1942, winner of one, Citizen Kane has stood the test of time and is still considered, to this day, one of the greatest films of all time. So why did it never get a remake? Other films have, after all. Listing a few off of the top of my head:

- *Dial “M” for Murder*, Alfred Hitchcock, 1954
- *The Magnificent Seven*, John Sturges, 1960
    - Based on *The Seven Samurai*, Akira Kurosawa
- *High Noon*, Fred Zinnemann, 1952
- *Annie*, Several People, Several Times

Before we get into the *why*, let’s get a little backstory on the movie.

## Orson Welles’ Film Debut

Orson Welles had an outstanding career. His films are recognized by many film junkies, and he is considered one of the greatest directors of all time. Interestingly, the film wasn’t given much budget, and Orson Welles didn’t spend much on the film at all. In fact, most of the scenes are done with cheap alternatives.

## What Makes the Movie So Great?

The story isn’t particularly outstanding; it is really well done, but, from a modern viewer’s perspective, it doesn’t really have anything that makes it “the best”. In fact, the usage of scenes seem hackneyed and cliché. But that’s what it *seems* like.

Confused? Well, let me explain.

A lot of the scene styles from Citizen Kane have grown to be classics in film since then. For instance, the scene in which Charles Foster Kane’s first marriage is summarized in three minutes.

Watching Citizen Kane without this knowledge would make you think, “Oh, great. Another one of *these* scenes.”

## So Why Can’t they Make a Remake?

Well, that’s all fine, but why can’t they make a remake? If the movie is *so good*, then what’s stopping Hollywood from making, at least, a cash grab?

Rights aside (since that’s not really something I want to research right now), there is one fatal flaw. What makes the original so great may be the remake’s downfall. See, the only thing particularly notable about Citizen Kane is the genius presentation of the story. The story is brilliant, I agree, but it’s all in the presentation. And the presentation is done beautifully.

**The thing is, people won’t want to watch the same old cliché scenes that have been used in movies — after all, Citizen Kane created those scenes, and this movie isn’t Citizen Kane; it’s a remake.**

The story can be recycled, but it won’t have nearly the same success as Citizen Kane.
