TL;DR: The archive is live. The home page works. One of my main projects is on the way.

## The Archive is up!

I already put this in a separate [article](http://blog.nishantkompella.me/2022/04/20/archive-is-live/), but the archive is live. So far, I have kept the CentOS Geek on the site and created a page for it. I’ll work on putting the rest up.

## Home Page Redirects

If you go to the [home page](http://nishantkompella.me), you’ll notice the top has a lot of redirects, including “Blog”, “Wiki”, and “C Tutorial”. Those initially led to a site saying:

> This site should automatically redirect to my \[blog/wiki/c tutorial\]. If it doesn’t, click here.

Of course, it wasn’t supposed to do that, and you were supposed to click the link provided. I fixed that. Now, it should automatically redirect you, thanks to the Redirect Plugin for WordPress.

## Got Five Minutes?

Speaking of redirects, I have a pet project I wanted to do – it would be a single button, which would redirect you to a site with a short activity. I’m planning on hosting it at button.nishantkompella.me.
