Whether it’s waking up with a headache, not sleeping because of a stuffy nose, or having the stomach flu, feeling sick is the worst. Here is an active list of things to do when you are sick.

## Headaches

In the case of a headache or migraine, you should bundle yourself up into a warm room and turn on a heater. If that doesn’t work, take 3 ibuprofen and 2 tylenol.

## Nausea

Arguably the worst (or one of the worst) symptoms of being sick, a cure for this is relatively easy. Pour some rubbing alcohol onto a tissue and sniff it.

## Stuffy Nose

I’m writing this with one right now. What I do, normally, is take a hot shower with the door closed. The steam thins out the mucus and clears out your nose. Humidifiers and other shit may help you too.

## Diarrhea

Avoid foods. Drink gatorade. Here are the foods you *can* eat:

- Bananas
- Toast
- Oats (with water, not milk)

Take anti-diarrhetic.
