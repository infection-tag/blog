Independence Day, here in the United States of America. My parents had some plans.

## Picnic

We started the day by picnicking at Coyote Point. We had lunch (Maggi Noodles and Grilled Zucchini, Tofu, and Bell Pepper Sandwiches), then walked around the area. Koko went into the water. She is no longer scared of water.

## Magic Mountain

After that, we went to Magic Mountain, the best playground in the area.

## Beach

Finally, we went to a beach nearby. I brought my dog to the water and she swam out there like a champ. She hates me now because she was super scared.

Iâ€™m really tired now.
