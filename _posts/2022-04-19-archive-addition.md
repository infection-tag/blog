TL;DR: I’m adding archives for all the sites below. Names, links, and backgrounds listed below.

I’m making this a separate article, because it’s gonna be a huge project.

This is one of the main reasons why I’m getting my own domain. If something happens, like I go full Joe Biden and get Alzhimer’s or I get hit by a car and lose all my memory, I’ll know that there is at least something up here that I can use to find what I had done recently.

These are all the things I will be archiving:

## [The CentOS Geek](http://centosgeek.blogspot.com)

All the articles I wrote to help people who don’t know anything about linux will go up here. Initially hosted on blogger, it will be going to its own folder.

## [The Camizz](http://thecamizz.wordpress.com)

Initially, I also created a wordpress for myself, called the Camizz. There was only one article on there, but I may one day expand on it. There are a ton of articles for study help, but most of them never saw the light of day. I may publish them here, if I find them worthy of it.

## [NiKo’s World](http://thenikok.blogspot.com)

Another blogger site, I created this just about myself. Nothing particularly interesting here, just an article I wrote when I was in San Diego about “the best word processors”.

## [The Effect](http://mageffect.blogspot.com)

A project I started with my friends. It was supposed to be a strictly politics-free magazine. There were only three articles on there, each posted between April 28 – 30. We were supposed to post a full magazine, but it kind of fell apart.

## nikok.ml

This website has long since been lost in time, but I think I still have the source code on GitHub. It has nothing much, just some buttons and a home page (kind of like the old home page of this site).

## [nishantkdtech.github.io](http://nishantkdtech.github.io)

A long time ago, about a week ago, I found that I could get a full-fledged domain for free with namecheap with the GitHub student developer pack. Naturally, it probed I use GitHub pages to host it, so I did. However, GitHub Pages is static and it’s kinda hard to host a wiki in that way. There was only one page (index.html) and a readme, but it’s still something I plan on hosting up here. I want to archive it because if I need the actual GitHub subdomain, I’m gonna have to clear out the domain and readme.

## How?

Currently, I’m looking at a subdomain, as I said earlier – archive.nishantkompella.me. I already registered it, but before I do anything, I just want to point out that I have, like, five of those already and more on the way. So, I was planning on giving it a rest and just creating a site at nishantkompella.me/archives. However, hosting it at a subdomain and keeping little folders for each site (archive.nishantkompella.me/centos-geek) seems more romantic.
