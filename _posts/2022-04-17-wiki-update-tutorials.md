Boring, boring documentation.

TL;DR: I blew away the old wiki and put in a brand new one because the old one was hard to use. I will import my [C tutorial](http://infection-tag.github.io) to my website at learn-c.nishantkompella.me. I’m trying to figure out how to add my [markdown tutorial](https://github.com/infection-tag/learn-markdown) as well.

I just updated the wiki. Because MediaWiki was hard to use, I swapped it out with DokuWiki. I simply couldn’t swap the logo on MediaWiki, and that kinda ruined the whole vibe of the wiki.

I also created a logo for the site, and added it in. Now that I have a fully customizable wiki, I added a theme (I chose Mikio) and added an article about my dog, just to get a feel for the software.

Currently my C tutorial is hosted at [infection-tag.github.io](http://infection-tag.github.io), but it has no good user interface and there is currently only one chapter (Chapter Two is still under development). Also, the home page is WAY out of order – the Introduction is in the middle of the table of contents, the Introduction to chapter one doesn’t include the exercises, and Chapter two is visible — with one page, titled “new note”, which 404s on you when you click the link.

I was thinking of using DokuWiki for hosting the C tutorial, with the theme “Argon”. Alternatively, I could just use HTML, since it’s a static site, but it would look ugly and I’d just be back to square one. The subdomain will be learn-c.nishantkompella.me.

Finally, I created a [markdown tutorial](https://github.com/infection-tag/learn-markdown) last year, but no one did it. I wanted to use markdown (for obvious reasons). This one is a lot trickier, because it isn’t a website format. The markdown files are meant to be edited directly, using [dillinger.io](http://dillinger.io) or something of the sort. It takes five minutes (which is why I’m probably going to add it to my “Got Five Minutes?” project). If I can find a way to embed a markdown editor directly into my website I can port it in. However, that will make it a lot like [this site](http://markdowntutorial.com).

I know this post was a little long, and you probably didn’t read through it, but I guess it goes to show I have too much time on my hands. I’ll update you (if you’re still here) when the other subdomains go live.
