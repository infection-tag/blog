## Scrapping C Tutorial

My [C Tutorial](http://learn-c.nishantkompella.me) has been around for a while, and I’ve found using DokuWiki pretty hard when it comes to formatting code. I’m probably going to scrap it and turn it into a book, but before I do that I’m going to try it with WordPress.

## Recipe Site is Live!

I added a recipe wiki to try to keep all my vegetarian recipes. Check it out [here](http://recipes.nishantkompella.me).

## Recent Events

I know I haven’t updated my site in a while, but I have been really busy fixing my grades. School ends on Friday, and I currently have a 3.4 GPA.

Anyways, there hasn’t been much going on recently. Yesterday I went to Great America for the first time in my life. I loved it. I went on the drop tower and the Demon.

## Ideas for Site

I added a little scheme as a joke with my friends on my site. Check it out [here](http://schemes.nishantkompella.me/prince-harry.html). I am also creating a subdomain for my future automatic dog toy company. Also, I’m developing a game in Ink. I’m probably going to add that to my website.

I may create a website for my game on my own using GitHub Pages.

## Knighthood

I know how I’m getting into college: knighthood.
