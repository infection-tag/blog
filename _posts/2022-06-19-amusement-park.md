I covered a little about this in a previous blog post, but here’s what I said regarding this issue:

A while back (a couple of weeks ago), I went down to Great America with my friends and had a lot of fun. Then, I realized that there doesn’t seem to be much creativity to roller coasters anymore — they all appear to be some variation of [Testsrecke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zicwXuTe9zU), and that isn’t saying much, seeing as the ride is one and a half minutes long.

So, I was thinking, why can’t I design my *own* amusement park with custom roller coasters?

Coming soon to an internet near you: [coasters.nishantkompella.me](http://coasters.nishantkompella.me)!

## Layout of the site

The home page of the site should be structure as follows: There is a map of the park, with several rides. If you click on a part of the image, it will redirect to another page made solely for the site. It’s not a wiki, per se; it’s more like a directory in which I can store information about all my rides.
