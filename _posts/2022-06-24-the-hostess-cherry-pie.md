I recently made the mistake of buying a Hostess® Mini Cherry Fruit Pie. Hostess is known for their classic sweets, like the Twinkie™, Zingers™, and their delicious cupcakes. I thought that, due to their reputable name, this fruit pie would be, at the least decent.

Oh, lord was I wrong. In this post, we’ll be breaking down everything wrong with the Mini Cherry Pie here.

## The Filling

Similar to a Pop Tart, the Pie is comprised of two parts: A glazed outer shell, and an inner filing. Unlike the Pop Tart, however, there is more filling and less glazing. At least, that’s what’s supposed to happen.

Normally, with pie filling, you expect the texture to be plasma-ish: not runny and liquidy, but should still flow. No such luck. With this pie, the inside seems to have been dumped with corn starch or something; it’s completely gelatin. What the hell, Hostess?

Also, the box displays many cherries inside the filling. I got, like, one.

## The Crust

Now for the outer shell. While the focus of the pie should be the stuffing (which they spectacularly botched up), it should also be noted that the crust is also wildly unsatisfactory. It is dumped with a high density of sugar as is. I feel like I’m dumping a maple syrup/sugar milkshake, with sugar in place of the milk.

## The Heating

Last, but not least: The heating. Why is it that the outside crust can get burned, while the inside resembles the iceberg that took down the Titanic? Why is there no even distribution of heat while sticking this into the microwave?

Your product sucks, Hostess. Fix it.
