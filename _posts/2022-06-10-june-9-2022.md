I *really* don’t want to write tonight, but I’m going to anyways, for habit’s sake.

## Swim Meet

I have a swim meet tomorrow and Sunday (the day after the day after tomorrow, as today is Thursday). I’m not going on Saturday because I have a concert for the LJYE.

## Adding to GitHub Pages

As I said in another [blog post](http://blog.nishantkompella.me/2022/06/08/bringing-back-github-site/), I’m trying to bring back my old [GitHub Pages](http://nishantkdtech.github.io) site. However, Ruby has been an absolute pain in the ass and I’m not planning to work with Jekyll because of this. However, [Hexo](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo), which seems to be 100% JavaScript, seems to be working so far.

That’s all for tonight. I’m gonna call it a day, as I have a swim meet tomorrow and I pulled something in my leg.
