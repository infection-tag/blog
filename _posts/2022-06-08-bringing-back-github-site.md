I may be bringing back my old [GitHub Pages Site](http://nishantkdtech.github.io). The plan is to showcase all of my worthy projects, including [the Button](http://button.nishantkompella.me), [my game](http://blog.nishantkompella.me/2022/06/06/game-update/), stories I have written, and more.

## How?

The site will be hosted on GitHub pages and made with Jekyll.

## Why?

This site has gotten a bit cluttered; the GitHub site will simply be a showcase.

## What will it look like?

It will look like [this blog](https://gabrieldwu.github.io/) from which I took inspiration. However, it will have more subpages, which go into more detail about each object I am showcasing.

## When?

It will probably be a couple of weeks, as I am pretty busy with my game.
