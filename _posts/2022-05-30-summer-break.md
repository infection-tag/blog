Summer is here! I am now free to do whatever I want — at least until June 13, when concurrent enrollment classes begin. Rejoice!

## Plans for Summer

- Doing 1 or 2 concurrent enrollment classes at the College of San Mateo
- Writing my video game
- Working on the dog toy
- Updating the blog regularly despite getting zero traffic
- Maybe visiting La Jolla, San Diego — AKA the best place on earth
- Maybe hanging out with friends
- Creating a fictional universe of characters
- Writing my second Sitcom Episode
