I know no one reads it. I guess it exists as a personal refuge. It’s there on the internet for anyone to read — I even had it indexed on Google. The question is, why does my site get no traffic?

In a sea of 1.7 Billion websites, no one has the time to care about my ideas and thoughts. I’m just a 14 year old boy with a MacBook and big dreams. This website may be lost in time at any point, can’t it?

Like I said earlier, it’s a personal refuge. A diary, of sorts, if we were to ignore the fact that I do have an actual diary — one that have not updated in a year and a half.

If something happens to me, this is the only way I can recover who I was. And the best part is, I don’t need to go through a full on scavenger hunt to find it. It’s there on the internet.

The internet is such a beautiful place, albeit a bit cluttered.
