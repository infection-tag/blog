I’m working on an astrophysical research paper. Hopefully I can get the thing done and sent to a professor at a good college before high school is over. The main idea of the paper is: *What if the Earth were a torus?* I’m currently working on it from a theoretical perspective.

(Warning: For joke purposes only!)</figcaption></figure>There are a lot more questions I hope to answer with this. According to my various sources, writing a paper like this is good to get into college.
