I am remaking my old markdown tutorial, because the old one sucks and has lost most of its formatting (which is the main thing of Markdown) in the conversion and upload to GitHub.

This one will be a lot better; you can work with it better and, hopefully, I will find a way to upload it onto this site.

The main idea will be this; you can fork several Markdown files, each with instructions on how to tweak it. Once forked, you can follow the instructions and complete it.
