Weed day is here!

## Grandparents

My grandparents are coming on Friday, and my parents have been cleaning like crazy. It’s a shame, though, because they’re only staying here for a couple of days. They will then go to San Diego – with my brother and my mother and NOT me – to celebrate my grandfather’s birthday.

I wish I could go to San Diego. I really want to go there more than anyone will ever know. It’s really a great place in comparison to this hellhole. But I have performances and classes and not enough time, so I’ll just be staying here, with my dad.

## Swim meet

I have a swim meet today. It’s one of the last ones of the season.

## Sitcom Funding

I have a meeting with some people who can fund my sitcom. I hope they agree to it. I have it in about twenty minutes. Wish me luck and I’ll update you in the future!
