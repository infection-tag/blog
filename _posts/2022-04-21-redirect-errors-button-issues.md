TL;DR: There have been some server errors on the blog. Also, the button site has been redirecting to the blog and I can’t fix it.

## Redirect Errors

I have had some database errors with redirections. I’m working to fix that; in the mean time, just reload the page once or twice and it should work.

## Button Issues

I have gotten some of [the button](http://button.nishantkompella.me) to work with redirection — however, I accidentally had it redirect to a link on this blog. The link exists on the button, but it doesn’t here, so it leads to a custom wordpress 404. I fixed the typo and it’s not updating, so I’m gonna try to fix that later.
