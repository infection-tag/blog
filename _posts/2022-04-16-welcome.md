Welcome to my blog! This site constantly goes through changes as I see fit, and I keep a sort of “Change Log” on this blog. In the mean time, [check out the wiki](http://wiki.nishantkompella.me).

## Navigation of this site

I got this site for free with the GitHub student Developer Pack and namecheap.com, and I plan to make the most of it. Some subdomains I plan on/am working on:

- [blog.nishantkompella.me](http://blog.nishantkompella.me) – Thoughts, tips, and tricks
- [wiki.nishantkompella.me](http://wiki.nishantkompella.me) – Personal Wiki
- hearmeout.nishantkompella.me – Will redirect to a separate site about my sitcoms
- [learn-c.nishantkompella.me](http://learn-c.nishantkompella.me) – [my C tutorial](http://infection-tag.github.io), but better-looking. Currently discontinued, at least until I can free up more inodes.
- tutorial.nishantkompella.me – some tutorials I have made before
- [gallery.nishantkompella.me](http://nishantkompella.me/photo-gallery/) – my photography gallery (Update: I moved it to [here](http://nishantkompella.me/photo-gallery/) because I didn’t want to reinstall WordPress on a new subdomain).
- maracaos.nishantkompella.me – a pet project titled MaracaOS
- fanclub.nishantkompella.me – redirects to a separate joke site my friends made

My main site ([nishantkompella.me](http://nishantkompella.me)) works as a little list of things on my site. It’s slightly outdated, but I plan on fixing that.
