*Or, “The movie critic paradox”.*

- - - - - -

I recently watched “The Man From Toronto”, which is a pretty enjoyable film. The critics, however thought otherwise. For some strange reason (and I say strange because they didn’t bother to elaborate), they gave the movie a 25%, collectively. In fact, one of these reviews simply said “A waste of Kevin Hart and Woody Harrelson’s talent”.

The thing is, movie critics watch these *for a living*, which means that they have probably seen a greater number of films than we will ever see. And that is the issue.

See, in order for us to *begin* to get something *close* to an accurate review of a movie, we need someone who hasn’t seen all the latest movies. The thing is, if one were to do that, they would need to watch movies more often, as they would need to review a lot of movies to make a living.

And that’s when we get back to square one.

Ironic, isn’t it?
